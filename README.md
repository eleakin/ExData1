Exploratory Data Analysis- Data Project 1
=========================

This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". There are 8 files for the Course Project 1: 4 R scripts and 4 .png files of the graphs.

To run this script you need to to the following:
* Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to some directory;
* Download the data from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
* Run the scripts from the directort where you put the files.
